# Welcome to Practice Spring

This application will be used to demonstrate some application concepts that are likely to be common across several BFH Project 1 projects.

Even though this application is built using the Kotlin
programming language, and the spring-boot framework, most of the concepts will still apply regardless of the particular technology choices for each given project.

## Application Documentation

The first common concept is demonstrated by this very website.   Most applications likely need user documention and this website will be used to host such documentation.  

The documentation for this website was built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), hosted as Github Pages, and deployed by putting in place the necessary Github action workflow.

The technology used to generate the documentation is not especially important, but it should provide capabilities similar to this website's capabilities.
